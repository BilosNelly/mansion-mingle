The app displays around 1000 properties from a fake backend. 
You can view all of the properties in a list and each property is displayed in a card containing a thumbnail image, the property's title and description. 
You can also search for specific properties by their title and description. 
When you click on a property card, you will be taken to a detailed property page where you can see a larger image, the property's title, description, and address. 
On the detailed view, the title and description are editable, so you can make changes if necessary.
